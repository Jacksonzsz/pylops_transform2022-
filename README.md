# PyLops Tutorial at Transform 2022

Material for the PyLops tutorial to be taught at [Transform 2022](https://softwareunderground.org/transform).

The material covered during the tutorial is composed of 2 jupyter notebooks. Participants can either use:

- local Python installation (simply run ``conda env create -f environment. yml``)
- a Cloud-hosted environment such as [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pylops/pylops_transform2022/main)
  or  Google Colab (use links provided below to open the notebook directly in Colab).

Note that a small portion of the second notebook requires access to a GPU and ``cupy`` installation. Do not worry if you do
not have access to this, either use Colab or simply skip those cells.

## Instructor

- Carlos Alberto da Costa Filho (cako), DarkVision Technologies Inc.
